Answer: To approach this problem, you should focus on learning the optimal policy (𝜋∗) and the optimal value function (𝑣∗) by interacting with the environment. Use the Bellman Optimality Equation to iteratively compute the optimal value function, which will help you infer the optimal policy. Consider the dynamics of the environment and the rewards associated with actions in different states. If the environment is deterministic, you can simplify your calculations. Aim to maximize the expected return (𝔼𝐺𝑡) through your chosen actions.

Answer: To approach the problem effectively, you should follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Environment**: Begin by familiarizing yourself with the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework, which consists of states (𝒮), actions (𝒜), and rewards (ℛ). Recognize that valid actions depend on the current state, and the environment dynamics are defined by the transition probabilities, which indicate the likelihood of moving from one state to another given a specific action [Chunk 1].

2. **Define Your Policy**: A policy (𝜋) is a function that assigns probabilities to actions based on the current state. Ensure you understand how to represent this policy mathematically, as it will guide your decision-making process [Chunk 4].

3. **Calculate Value Functions**: Learn how to compute the state value function (𝑣𝜋 𝑠), which represents the expected return starting from state 𝑠 and following policy 𝜋. This is crucial for evaluating how good a particular state is under a given policy [Chunk 4].

4. **Aim for Optimality**: Your goal is to find the optimal policy (𝜋∗) and the optimal value function (𝑣∗ 𝑠). The optimal value function gives the maximum expected return over all possible policies. Familiarize yourself with the Bellman Optimality Equation, which provides a recursive way to compute the optimal value function [Chunk 5].

5. **Iterate Using Value Iteration**: If you know the environment dynamics, you can apply the Bellman Optimality Equation iteratively to compute the optimal value function to arbitrary precision. This method is known as value iteration and is a common approach in model-based reinforcement learning [Chunk 6].

6. **Consider Discounting**: In scenarios where future rewards are less valuable than immediate rewards, apply a discount factor (𝛾) to your calculations. This factor will help you balance the importance of immediate versus future rewards, which is essential for maximizing the expected return [Chunk 4].

By following these steps, you will systematically build your understanding and approach to solving the problem within the context of reinforcement learning.
