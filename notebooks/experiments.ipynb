Recognize that valid actions depend on the current state, and the environment dynamics are defined by the transition probabilities, which indicate the likelihood of moving from one state to another given a specific action [Chunk 1].\n",

            "\n",

            "4. **Aim for Optimality**: Your goal is to find the optimal policy (𝜋∗) and the optimal value function (𝑣∗ 𝑠). The optimal value function gives the maximum expected return over all possible policies. Familiarize yourself with the Bellman Optimality Equation, which provides a recursive way to compute the optimal value function [Chunk 5].\n",

            "5. **Iterate Using Value Iteration**: If you know the environment dynamics, you can apply the Bellman Optimality Equation iteratively to compute the optimal value function to arbitrary precision. This method is known as value iteration and is a common approach in model-based reinforcement learning [Chunk 6].\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Consider Discounting**: In scenarios where future rewards are less valuable than immediate rewards, apply a discount factor (𝛾) to your calculations. This factor will help you balance the importance of immediate versus future rewards, which is essential for maximizing the expected return [Chunk 4].\n",
