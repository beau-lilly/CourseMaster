## Final Project

At the end of the course, students will complete a final project of their choice using any of the techniques from the course. You might choose to build a web or mobile application powered by AI such, attempt a data science / machine learning competition or hackathon style task, such as the featured challenges regularly posted on Kaggle, or reproduce the results of a research study published in venues like NeurIPS or ICML.

You are strongly encouraged to use state-of-the-art machine learning models for building your final project. While some projects may necessitate building and training a model completely from scratch, it is much more likely that most projects will be best served by fine-tuning, adapting, integrating, or otherwise working with existing models as a starting point. Similarly, you are strongly encouraged to select a project that can be completed using only publicly available data – that is, that will not require you to collect your own data given the time constraints of the semester.

### **Final Project AI Usage**

You may use generative AI (such as DukeGPT) to help develop your final project, even including the use of AI-generated code (unlike for homework assignments). However, you must attribute any AI-generated code (for example, by providing details about the authors and generations in the comments) and you are fully responsible for the work you submit (that is, “but that’s what the AI said” would not be a valid defense if one were to lose credit due to errors or inconsistencies in the code).

### **Final Project Collaboration**

You can work on the final project alone or in a group of two (that is, with a single partner). Partner projects will be expected to demonstrate more substantial results. For this reason, you should work with a partner if you want to work on a more ambitious project, not just to reduce the amount of work.

### **Project Workshops**

Several class periods near the end of the semester are dedicated as “project workshop.” This is additional dedicated time set aside for you to work on your projects in-class with easy access to instructor and TA discussion, help, and support. Attendance is required unless you have already completed and submitted your final project.

### **Submission Requirements**

The final project should be submitted as a project repository including the following components. You will submit a simple link to this repository on Gradescope.

- **Software:** This should be a publicly accessible Github or Gitlab repository with all project code, data, and documentation. The repository must follow the organizational structure outlined below to ensure clear presentation of your work and efficient grading.
- **Project Demo:** This is a 3–5-minute video that shows what your project does and why that matters. Think of this as the video you would show a non-specialist to pitch what you built. There is no reason to show any code in this video – you can use slides with visualizations or diagrams to provide motivation, show the running application, show experimental results, etc. This video should be included in your repository and linked prominently in your README file.
- **Technical Walkthrough:** This is a 5–10-minute video that shows and discusses how your project works. Think of this as the video you would show a fellow ML engineer to explain how you accomplished what you did. This video should help orient a grader to understand how your code works and where the machine learning concepts are being applied. It should also help a grader understand what was challenging about the project and where the significant technical contributions can be found. Like the project demo, this video should be stored in your repository and clearly linked in your README file.

### **Repository Organization Requirements**

Your project repository must include the following structure and files to facilitate clear evaluation of your work:

- **Required Files.** The following markdown files should appear in the top level repository.
    - Your repository must contain a README.md file that serves as the main project overview and follows the template requirements specified below.
    - You must also include a SETUP.md file that provides clear installation and setup instructions for running your project. If your project uses external APIs or services, you should provide clear instructions for graders on how they can test your system.
    - Additionally, you must include an ATTRIBUTION.md file that contains detailed attribution of AI-generated code, external libraries, datasets, and any other resources used in your project.
- **Directory Structure.** Your repository should follow this organizational structure:
    - a src directory containing any of your source code that is not in Jupyter notebooks,
    - a data directory for any data files or data access scripts,
    - a models directory for any trained models, model configurations, or model loading scripts
    - a notebooks directory for Jupyter notebooks used for exploration or analysis,
    - a videos directory containing your demo and technical walkthrough videos,
    - a docs directory for any additional documentation,
    - and a txt file or environment.yml file for any dependency management.
- **md File Requirements:** Your README.md file must include these sections in the specified order. Where appropriate, you should include sample outputs or screenshots in your README file to demonstrate your project’s functionality. Your README.md should be a concise reference and usage guide – your videos should present the primary explanation and discussion.
    - **Project Title** and short (1-3 sentence) description of what your project does,
    - a **What it Does** section that describes in one paragraph what your project does,
    - a **Quick Start** section that concisely explains how to run your project,
    - a **Video Links** section with direct links to your demo and technical walkthrough videos,
    - an **Evaluation** section that presents any quantitative results, accuracy metrics, or qualitative outcomes from testing,
    - and an **Individual Contributions** section for group projects that describes who did what.

### **Suggestions, Timeline, and Grading**

You are not expected to be working on the project during the first half of the semester, though you are encouraged to begin imagining what you might be interested in building — if there are particular data domains of interest, methodologies, competitions, applications, etc. that you might like to work on for personal interest or as part of curating your own professional portfolio.

More detailed suggestions on possible projects and the complete grading rubric will be released as a separate handout by midterm (after the first exam). At this point you should begin concretely planning for your project and discussing ideas with prospective partners, if you are considering working with a partner. You should begin looking for data sources, exploring relevant models and APIs, experimenting, etc. It is very important that you have some concrete ideas for what will do in your project by the time of the second exam.

After the second exam, rest of the semester is dedicated entirely to working on your project, and you should expect to spend a substantial amount of time in and out of class working on your project during the last weeks of the course.
